# blurhash GPU implementation with OpenCL

This project implements blurhash algorithm on GPU using OpenCL. The original algorithm written in C language was used as a prototype for GPU algorithm (you can find it on the blurhash official github [here](https://github.com/woltapp/blurhash)).

This GPU algorithm works for images of differet sizes.
